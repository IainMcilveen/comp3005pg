# comp3005 project
This is the final project from comp3005, here I implemented a program designed to act as a bookstore where users can login and search for, checkout, and buy books. The owners of the book store can add new/remove books, and get a sales report.
This was written in Node.js and express, using pug as the template engine to provide the pages to the user and connected to PostgreSQL to store all of the information about the books
